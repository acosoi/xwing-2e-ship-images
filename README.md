# xwing-2e-ship-images
Images of ships from X-Wing: The Miniatures Game - Second Edition by Fantasy Flight Games

All images are 256 x 256 PNGs with transparent backgrounds. The project is structured similarly to [xwing-data2](https://github.com/guidokessels/xwing-data2/) by [Guido Kessels](https://github.com/guidokessels).

Only ships that have been released for Second Edition are included in this list. I did not include ships from First Edition that have only been launched in Conversion Kits but not in standalone expansions.

The status of each ship is color-coded below:

* ![#00ff00](https://placehold.it/15/00ff00/000000?text=+) OK
* ![#ffff00](https://placehold.it/15/ffff00/000000?text=+) Low Quality Image
* ![#ff0000](https://placehold.it/15/ff0000/000000?text=+) Not Available
